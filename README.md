# Reboot a Spring Boot application to rotate a new database credential from Vault when the lease expired

***Notice: The application is created for the propose of technical demonstration. The solution should never be used in production environment.***

# Acknowledgement
The application exists because of a prestigious blog post named  [Hashicorp Vault max_ttl Killed My Spring App](https://secrets-as-a-service.com/posts/hashicorp-vault/spring-boot-max_ttl/).

The blog post gives four solutions to resolve a spring vault issue that the database credentials will not be rotated after the lease expired its max_ttl. For detail about the issue, pls refer to [here](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-vault/issues/256).

The application is a Java implementation of solution 3 using **APPROLE** authentication and tested with OpenJDK11-OpenJ9, vault v1.3.2 and MongoDB v3.6.

# Getting Started

## Vault
The application uses **APPROLE** authentication, and here is the configuration of vault as follows.
1. Start `Vault` server in development mode
    ```
    vault server -dev
    ```
2. Export an environment variable for local connection
    ```
    export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:8200'
    ```
3. Create a new auth method named __"approle"__
    ```
    vault auth enable approle
    ```
4. Create a new policy path named __"app-policy"__ and use hcl file to create policies of the path in order to get/renew database credentials (The fcl file locates under `vault` folder.)
    ```
    vault write sys/policy/app-policy policy=@app-policy.hcl
    ```
5. Create a `readwrite` path in "approle" with unlimited tokens and secret ids
    ```
    vault write auth/approle/role/readwrite secret_id_ttl=100m token_num_uses=0 token_ttl=100m token_max_ttl=100m secret_id_num_uses=0 policies="default,app-policy"
    ```
6. (Optional) Enable database secrets if it disabled
    ```
    vault secrets enable database
    ```
7. Create a MongoDB config named __"app-mongodb"__ and add its connection info.
    ```
    vault write database/config/app-mongodb plugin_name=mongodb-database-plugin allowed_roles="readwrite" connection_url="mongodb://{{username}}:{{password}}@[myip]/admin?ssl=false" username="[myusername]" password="[mypassword]"
    ```
8.  Configure a role that maps the MongoDB config to a MongoDB command that executes and creates the database credential (Here, `ttl` is 2 minutes and `max_ttl` is 5 minutes) 
    ```
    vault write database/roles/readwrite db_name=app-mongodb creation_statements='{ "db": "vaultdemo", "roles": [{ "role": "dbOwner" }, {"role": "readWrite", "db": "vaultdemo"}] }' default_ttl="2m" max_ttl="5m"
    ```
9. Get `role-id` which will be the value of `spring.cloud.vault.app-role.role-id`
    ```
    vault read auth/approle/role/readwrite/role-id
    ```
10. Get `secret-id` which will be the value of `spring.cloud.vault.app-role.secret-id`
    ```
    vault write -f auth/approle/role/readwrite/secret-id
    ```
## Spring boot
1. Configure `spring.cloud.vault.app-role.role-id` and `spring.cloud.vault.app-role.secret-id` in `bootstrap.yml`.
2. Configure host and port of MongoDB in `application.yml`.
3. Start the application.
3. Access POST http://localhost:8080 to init some data and GET http://localhost:8080 to retrieve them. 

# Console Output
There are several logs shows the application do renew the database credential. After about 5 minutes, the lease is expired (because `max_ttl` is `5m`) the application is rebooted.
